Is there a way to obtain correct valuation of a stock.
Compare the correct valuation with the predicted price
Get the bias values
Can the likelihood of overvaluation/undervaluation in a stock be predicted.
How can I plot actual valuation of a stock with time?
How can one measure indivisual biases? Baisian and some useless factors or can one predict the bias in a just by evaluating one's transaction
So, can financial biases be measured by evaluating the portfolio transaction
