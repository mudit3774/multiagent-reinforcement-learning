What is a cognitive bias/Irrationality?
========================================

A cognitive bias is a pattern of deviation in judgment that occurs in particular situations, which may sometimes lead to perceptual distortion, inaccurate judgment, illogical interpretation, or what is broadly called irrationality. Irrationality is cognition, thinking, talking or acting without inclusion of rationality. It is more specifically described as an action or opinion given through inadequate use of reason, emotional distress, or cognitive deficiency. Theories of Irrationality:

What are the theories of irrational behavior?
=============================================

1. (***)people's actual interests differ from what they believe to be their interests.
2. mechanisms that have evolved to give optimal behavior in normal conditions lead to irrational behavior in abnormal conditions.
3. (***)situations outside one's ordinary circumstances, where one may experience intense levels of fear, or may regress to a fight-or-flight mentality.
4. (***)people fail to realize the irrationality of their actions and believe they are acting perfectly rational, possibly due to flaws in their reasoning.
5. apparently irrational decisions that are actually optimal, but made unconsciously on the basis of "hidden" interests that are not known to the conscious mind.
6. an inability to comprehend the social consequences of one's own actions, possibly due in part to a lack of empathy.
7. Some people find themselves in this condition by living "double" lives. They try to put on one "mask" for one group of people and another for a different group of people. Many will become confused as to which they really are or which they wish to become.

What factors broadly affect rational behavior?
==============================================

1. stress, which in turn may be emotional or physical
2.(***) the introduction of a new or unique situation
3. intoxication
4. (***)peers who convey irrational thoughts as necessary idiosyncrasy for social acceptance

What is bounded reality?
========================

Bounded rationality is the idea that in decision-making, rationality of individuals is limited by the information they have, the cognitive limitations of their minds, and the finite amount of time they have to make a decision. It was proposed by Herbert A. Simon as an alternative basis for the mathematical modeling of decision making, as used in economics and related disciplines

What has computational intelligence has to do with bounded rationality?
=======================================================================

From a computational point of view, decision procedures can be encoded in algorithms and heuristics. Edward Tsang argues that the effective rationality of an agent is determined by its computational intelligence. Everything else being equal, an agent that has better algorithms and heuristics could make "more rational" (more optimal) decisions than one that has poorer heuristics and algorithms.
